# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for 
projects within the [Causely Open Source GitHub Organization](https://github.com/causely-oss/)

## Reporting a Bug

The Causely team and community take all security bugs in
Causely Open Source projects seriously. Thank you for improving the security of
our projects. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and
will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, 
the preferred way is to use the `Report a vulnerability` button on the `Security` tab
in the respective GitHub repository. It creates a private communication channel 
between the reporter and the maintainers.

If you are absolutely unable to or have strong reasons not to use GitHub reporting workflow, 
please reach out to security@causely.ai.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email as soon as possible, and will send a
more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
  released as quickly as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
